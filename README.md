# Virtual-digital-assistant-TelegramBOT
The virtual digital assistant helps university students to study the disciplines "Databases" and "Software Engineering", as well as quickly get their schedule and even or odd academic week through bot commands.

Answers to questions from the database on disciplines. The user's question is compared to the keywords using the Levenshtein distance method, and the answer is retrieved from the database.
